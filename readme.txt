Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
=============================

Basic idea: 
Code words Xi are generated by linear combinations of "generator words" Gi
The generator words Gi are derived by  logical shifting of a generator paatern
Code words have a numnber m databits, k control bits
Alltogether the word including crc has n=m+k bits.

Example:
========
          1  0  1  1 Generator pattern
x  x  x  x  x  x  x
 7  6  5  4  3  2  1  

0  0  0  1  0  1  1	G1

0  1  0  1  1  0  0	G3
1  0  1  1  0  0  0	G4
